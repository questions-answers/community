If you don't see these Questions sections, then go to settings page and check that you have both _Global Questions_ and _Space Questions_ enabled:

### Enable Questions only for selected spaces

### Working with questions

_Questions and Answers for Confluence_ enforces some rules that are worth to know:

* Questions and answers cannot be upvoted by their author,
* Only question author can mark some answer as accepted,
* Only author can edit his/her questions and answers,
* Space admins can delete all questions and answers.
